This is basically AI generated slime mold simulator. I never used ImGui or SDL libraries, but it evolved this way.
I just randomly asked ChatGPT to create it, use SDL cause I wanted to try it for other project anyways, then it
was upgraded to SDL3 and ImGui was added.

Optimizations were done by me. 

More is in my [blog article](https://www.pavelp.cz/posts/eng-random-chatgpt-code/) with initial, more simple code.
